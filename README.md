# This video is a walkthrough of a CRUD app that focuses on the backend. There is little to no modification for the front end. The app is able to create, read, update and delete products for a shop called GoodsForABrightFuture. The app is able to create warehouses/locations to assign the inventory.

# Run npm install, npm run seed, then npm run start:dev. Open another browser and enter https://goodsforbrightfuture.anhduong8.repl.co/ in case replit browser does not show.
