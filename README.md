- This video is a walkthrough of a CRUD app that focuses on the backend. There is little to no modification for the front end. The app is able to create, read, update and delete products for a shop called GoodsForABrightFuture. The app is able to create warehouses/locations to assign the inventory.

- There are two ways to run this application:

 1. Open replit at https://replit.com/@AnhDuong8/GoodsForBrightFuture#README.md and run. Or run by npm run start:dev.

 2. Fork this repo. Run npm install -> create a postgres database name goodsforbrightfuture -> connect to database -> npm run seed -> npm run start:dev -> localhost:8000
