 This video is a walkthrough of a CRUD app that focuses on the backend. There is little to no modification for the front end. The app is able to create, read, update and delete products for a shop called GoodsForABrightFuture. The app is able to create warehouses/locations to assign the inventory.

There are two ways to run this applications:

 1. Open replit at https://replit.com/@AnhDuong8/GoodsForBrightFuture#README.md. On system environment variables, enter DATABASE_URL for key and value is a postgres database url.
